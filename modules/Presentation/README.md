The only important file is presentation.py

Helpers.py contains a few helper functions.

test_data_generator.py simply returns test_data.

Purgatory.py is for old / no longer relevant code / earlier versions of stuff.
Its just to show the progress, and that I've been through a few iterations before I landed on whats in presentation.py
Just so it doesnt look like I've spent a week on a few filter methods and a few simple .plot functions.
For some reason I had a hard time getting the structure right.
