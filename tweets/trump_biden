b'  The Narc In Chief is eyeing the November Election\n\nCue the nonstop lying and gaslighting through tweets, positive spin TV and his parade of sycophants\n\n@realDonaldTrump is a proven Liar and Divider, and is profoundly Unfit to serve as #POTUS\n#Trump #GoJoe #Biden #TrumpIsAnIdiot pic.twitter.com/4IimlZfhgi\n'

b' #Biden, fully vetted in 2008, no sexual assault history, and a now-withdrawn assault claim?\n\n*Crisis*.\n\n"Grab-\'em-by-the-p*ssy" #trump, who cheated on and divorced two wives, cheated on his third wife with a porn star, and denies 25+ credible assault claims?\n\nNo problem.\n\nGot it. pic.twitter.com/HnDTyYcioI\n'
b' #Trump vs #Biden. One smart dog. pic.twitter.com/hpqYrNm1Fr\n'
b'  Trump\xe2\x80\x99s MENTAL HEALTH needs to be THE national topic of discussion\n\nHe continually exhibits shocking behavior. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be desensitized. #GOP must act\n\nTrump is profoundly Unfit to be the #POTUS\n#Trump #GoJoe #Biden #TrumpIsAnIdiot #Biden2020 pic.twitter.com/7KWMbWErgK\n'
b'  I assume no one is surprised that a #Trump support would believe anything against #Biden while ignoring the glaring truth that is a Rapist. pic.twitter.com/11o3a4o0kJ\n'
b'  It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy to wake up to #Biden supporters who think groping little children is the same as #Trump telling a friend that because he\xe2\x80\x99s a celebrity, girls just throw themselves at him and he can bang them (which is a true). \n\nI pray for your own children. \n\n#Bidenisarapist\n'
b'  Do not take political parties too seriously. Many times, they debated on things that have no conclusion or they already know the outcomes. #Trump vs #Biden\n\nAs for geopolitical debates, just sit back and watch. Dont get too serious about it. It is just a movie.\n'
b'  Joe #Biden is the perfect guy to clean up the huge mess #Trump has made. \n\nAmerica will be respected & lead the world again instead of being a laughing stock w/ the current childish idiot in office.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden will put protecting American lives above all else.\n#GoJoe\n'

b"  Why is #Trump a bad leader?\n\nWhy is #Biden a better leader? \n\nWhy didn't you credit #Trump for the good work (if any)\n\nWhy didn't they work together? Power? Parties? Mindset?\n"
b'  It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing scrolling news sites and seeing so much on this Biden/Reade story. Was even half this much attention paid to the 26 women who\xe2\x80\x99ve accused #Trump of similar acts?\n\nIs it so one-sided because #Biden spoke out? Whereas Trump simply ignores, denies and deflects. pic.twitter.com/FiZyshFFVi\n'
b' #Trump has lost the support of a former devotee, veteran David Weissman, who is now a Democrat supporting Joe #Biden. Weissman explains his transformation to Joy Reid, telling AM JOY, \xe2\x80\x98I learned that many things I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told for many years are false.\xe2\x80\x99 msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/t\xe2\x80\xa6\n'

b'  Black people in big rush to vote for a guy who drafted a bill in 1994 to \xe2\x80\x9ctake them out of society\xe2\x80\x9d.  If you don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to Black people then do your research of who was the focal point of this bill.\n\n#Trump #Trump2020 #BlackTwitter #Biden2020 #Biden pic.twitter.com/VwTQxXGTKI\n'
b"  Good morning..\n\nIf.. #Trump grabbed'em by the p*ssy and #Biden slipped a finger in.. Then #AlexJones should run and he's likely to win because.............. pic.twitter.com/ZDlsTz6Ey5\n"
b" #Biden #Trump If you are voting for Biden just because you hate Trump, and vice versa... just stop.\n\nYou have to focus and you have to be a rational adult, don't vote for someone out of hate your enemy, vote because you agree with a candidate!\n"
b'  You do realize #Biden best Sarah Palin, Paul Ryan and Bernie Sanders in debates. #Trump will be a piece of cake\n'
