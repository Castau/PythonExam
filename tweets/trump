b'  Our neighbor cut down our Trump 2020 flag in our front yard last night. It\xe2\x80\x99s being replaced immediately. We will win 2020! #Trump2020 #Trump #Ohio @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr pic.twitter.com/Ao0dbMY98E\n'
b'  President Barack Obama was not responsible for the death of  nearly 70,000 American citizens and rising. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t #ImpeachedForLife either. Just admit that the ONLY Black US President rocked the presidency and was a success story. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #trump #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath\n'
b"  Don Lemon #Trump is a pathetic loser who can't stand to see a black man be better than him. It gives him nightmares. Trump has ODS Obama Derangement Syndrome pic.twitter.com/LdaY54gPRW\n"

b"  Here's several #USPS workers who were hard at work in our neighborhood today, transferring several parcels in the middle of a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Just another reason why we need to make sure #Trump & Co. aren't allowed to destroy our postal service. pic.twitter.com/swYDI9UnDr\n"

b" #trump first said 60K #COVID19 deaths would be a success. We surpassed that. Then he said 70K would be a success. We are easily going to surpass that. Now, he's saying 100K deaths is a success.\n\nOnce we get a true picture from testing...he will be saying 500K is a huge success!!!\n"
b' #Trump is encouraging this. These are not \xe2\x80\x9cfine\xe2\x80\x9d people! pic.twitter.com/ZsdxEmzedt\n'
b' #PresidentBarackObama\n \nWas a president who was connected with reality.\n\nA president who was in acceptance of fact.\n\nA president who was in position to dictate terms unlike #Trump\n\nA president who was loved by all! pic.twitter.com/TOnyZOr3Dm\n'
b'  The @GOP just admitted #Trump knew in January that a Plague was coming, but failed to put the testing in place and now tens of thousands have died in a preventable pandemic. The death toll is 10X higher than it would Have been if social distancing started 2 weeks sooner. twitter.com/gop/status/125\xe2\x80\xa6\n'
b"  I've been hesitant to express this sentiment, but after the last 24 hours:\n\nAttacks #GeorgeWBush for his message of unity\nThinks 80-100K deaths is acceptable\nThrows a temper tantrum about how he's treated worst, IN FRONT OF LINCOLN!\n\nAny Dem. would be gone. Time for #Trump to go. pic.twitter.com/3qds2gISQf\n"
b'  Hey #Trump... not only did you not have a \xe2\x80\x9cworking weekend\xe2\x80\x9d it looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re off to another lazy-ass Do-Nothing weekday again. Worst, most incompetent president ever...\n'
b'  What amazes me about #Trump supporters is that they put their loyalty to him above the safety of their own children and grandchildren.\n'

b'  No... no one\xe2\x80\x99s giving you \xe2\x80\x9cgreat reviews\xe2\x80\x9d. To the contrary, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s saying how unconscionably incompetent you are and how badly you screwed this up. But go ahead and keep MAGAsturbatin\xe2\x80\x99... #Trump #coronavirus #COVID19\n'
b' #MondayMood remembering my Dad\xe2\x80\x99s descent into #Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and how we tried to make the world kinder and safer for him. As #Trump unravels, his greedy family is riding that stumbling horse straight to the glue factory for a few more bucks and a few more moments in the spotlight. pic.twitter.com/cLNNWAlVMi\n'
b'  Trump\xe2\x80\x98s incompetent response to this pandemic needs to be fully vetted\n\nTrump admin was well aware of the threat based on intelligence briefings in November and the potential impact understood from the Crimson Contagion pandemic simulation \n\nNo Excuses\n\n#Trump #TrumpIsAnIdiot pic.twitter.com/UXqxEkXDdh\n'
b'  Trump knew in NOVEMBER. He can LIE and say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know until January over and over but that won\xe2\x80\x99t bring the 10s of 1000s of dead Americans back to us. #Trump #TrumpLiedPeopleDied pic.twitter.com/z7oBsRTByH\n'
